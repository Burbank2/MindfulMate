GENERAL OVERVIEW:

MindfulMate is an app with the purpose of helping users that struggle with ADHD and/or ADD. This app can also be beneficial for any user that struggles with distractions or lost time. By incorporating many different support options/methods in this app, the hope is that the end user will feel more productive in their everyday lives. Many users (including myself) waste precious time by swapping between different applications. Distractions are a common problem in today's world. Moving from one application to another can also distract the user. Getting side tracked in the middle of a planned task is another negative time consuming risk. 

WHAT DOES MINDFULMATE OFFER?:

With the ability to create different tasks or To-Do lists, the end-user can eilimate any sort of third party applications that has the sole purpose of managing different lists. With this feature integrated with MindfulMate, the user spends less time swapping between different applications. 
If you're like me, my calendar is extremely full and often struggle to remember what the day/week has planned for me. By allowing a calendar within the application, the end-user can successfully coordinate their day/week while also adjusting their to-do list. No more swapping back and forth between these two applications! Another feature that is being considered is a timed app restriction. At the user's controls, they can start a session that blocks certain apps in a cetegory or even custom settings. This will allow the end-user to spend less time mindlessly scrolling on social media for example.
